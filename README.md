# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Repository**! This repository is designed to help developers, both beginners and intermediates, strengthen their JavaScript knowledge through practical problems and engaging mini-projects. With hands-on coding challenges and structured projects, you'll develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections for better organization and learning flow:

### 1. **Practice Problems**
   - **Location**: `Practice Problems/`
   - **Description**: A collection of coding challenges tailored to improve fundamental JavaScript skills. Each problem focuses on a specific concept like loops, conditionals, DOM manipulation, or event handling.
   - **Files**: 
     - `.html`: Contains the basic structure and elements needed for the problem.
     - `.js`: A scaffold or a blank file where you can implement the solution.
     - `.css` (if applicable): Provides optional styling for the problem interface.
   - **Examples**:
     - Problem 1: Calculate the sum of array elements.
     - Problem 2: Implement a counter using DOM manipulation.
     - Problem 3: Validate a form input.

### 2. **Mini-Projects**
   - **Location**: `Mini-Projects/`
   - **Description**: Real-world inspired small projects designed to simulate common programming scenarios. These projects combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS to deliver interactive and functional applications.
   - **Current Projects**:
     1. **Tic Tac Toe**:
        - **Files**: `index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`
        - **Details**: A classic game where two players compete to align three symbols.
     2. **Rock Paper Scissors** *(Work in Progress)*:
        - **Files**: `index.html`, `index.js`
        - **Details**: A simple game showcasing basic decision-making logic.
     3. **Currency Converter** *(Work in Progress)*:
        - **Files**: `index.html`, `index.js`
        - **Details**: An application for converting amounts between different currencies.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Open the `index.html` file of any project in a browser.
     - Customize the `index.js` file to add new features or tweak existing functionality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the repository and begin coding:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to download the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd JavaScript
   ```

2. **Install a Code Editor**  
   For the best experience, use a modern code editor like **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, which provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging support.

3. **Run the Files**  
   - Open any `HTML` file in your browser to view the live interface.
   - Modify the associated `JavaScript` and `CSS` files to customize or implement logic.

4. **Debugging and Learning**  
   - Use browser developer tools (accessible via F12 or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect") to debug your JavaScript code.
   - Add `console.log()` statements in the `.js` files to monitor variable states and outputs.
